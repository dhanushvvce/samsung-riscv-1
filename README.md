<summary> <b>Task 1</b></summary>
<br>
The task involves referring to lab videos on C programming and RISC-V, and performing the compilation of C code using both the GCC compiler and the RISC-V compiler.
   
## C Language
### Compilation using GCC Compiler

Steps to compile any `.c` file :

1. Open the bash terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your file.
2. Run the following command to create and open the file in the editor:
   ```bash
   gedit sum1ton.c
3. Use these commands to run the C code:
    ```bash
   gcc sum1ton.c
   ./a.out

## RISC-V
Compile the code using the RISC-V GCC compiler using these commands:
1. Display c code:
   ```bash
   cat sum1ton.c
2. Command to compile code
   ```
   riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c
3. Displays the assembly language code
   ```
   riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o

<summary><b>Task 2</b></summary>
<br>
This task involves comparing two optimization levels, -O1 and -Ofast, while debugging a simple C program using SPIKE.

## Debugging with SPIKE

![VirtualBox_vdsworkshop_13_01_2025_19_06_42](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbd9a387-1df4-40c2-aa91-e320ec984e4e)

The C code was compiled

In order to balance compilation time and performance, the -O1 optimisation option offers modest optimisation. It's perfect for a combination of performance enhancements that don't significantly affect debugging. Conversely, -Ofast aggressively optimises for optimal performance, even at the expense of adhering to some standard-compliant behaviours and possibly making debugging more difficult.
The code undergoing these optimisations can be seen in the attached file.

Each optimisation level's RISC-V object dump (-O1 and -Ofast).

By disassembling the object file, the riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump tool reveals the machine code produced by each optimisation level:
The code undergoing these optimisations can be seen in the attached file.

# RISC-V and Its Instruction Formats

## Overview of RISC-V
RISC-V is an open-source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) that allows developers to design processors optimized for specific applications. Built on the principles of Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC), RISC-V represents the fifth generation of processors following this concept. Its open and free design enables developers to utilize RISC-V without licensing fees, making it an appealing alternative to proprietary processor architectures.

---

## Instruction Formats in RISC-V
An instruction format outlines the structure of machine language instructions executed by a processor. These instructions, composed of binary data (0s and 1s), provide details on data locations and operations.

RISC-V defines six primary instruction formats:

1. **R-format**
2. **I-format**
3. **S-format**
4. **B-format**
5. **U-format**
6. **J-format**

Below is a detailed explanation of each format.

---

### 1. R-type Instructions
**R-type (Register-type)** instructions work with registers rather than memory locations and are used for arithmetic and logical operations.

#### Structure:
| Field Name | Size   | Description                     |
|------------|--------|---------------------------------|
| Opcode     | 7 bits | Specifies the instruction type  |
| rd         | 5 bits | Destination register            |
| func3      | 3 bits | Defines the operation type      |
| rs1        | 5 bits | First source register           |
| rs2        | 5 bits | Second source register          |
| func7      | 7 bits | Additional operation specifier  |

#### Example: ADD r9, r2, r5
- **Operation**: Adds the values in registers `r2` and `r5`, storing the result in `r9`.
- **32-bit Instruction**: `0000000_00101_00010_000_01001_0110011`

---

### 2. I-type Instructions
**I-type (Immediate-type)** instructions utilize a register and an immediate (constant) value. These are commonly used for load and immediate operations.

#### Structure:
| Field Name | Size   | Description                     |
|------------|--------|---------------------------------|
| Opcode     | 7 bits | Specifies the instruction type  |
| rd         | 5 bits | Destination register            |
| func3      | 3 bits | Defines the operation type      |
| rs1        | 5 bits | Source register                 |
| imm[11:0]  | 12 bits| Immediate value                 |

#### Example: ADDI r12, r4, 5
- **Operation**: Adds the immediate value `5` to the value in `r4` and stores it in `r12`.
- **32-bit Instruction**: `000000000101_00100_000_01100_0010011`

---

### 3. S-type Instructions
**S-type (Store-type)** instructions write register values to memory locations.

#### Structure:
| Field Name | Size   | Description                     |
|------------|--------|---------------------------------|
| Opcode     | 7 bits | Specifies the instruction type  |
| rs1        | 5 bits | Base address register           |
| rs2        | 5 bits | Source register                 |
| imm[11:5]  | 7 bits | Upper immediate value           |
| imm[4:0]   | 5 bits | Lower immediate value           |
| func3      | 3 bits | Defines the operation type      |

#### Example: SW r3, 2(r1)
- **Operation**: Stores the value in `r3` to the memory address `r1 + 2`.
- **32-bit Instruction**: `0000000_00011_00001_010_00010_0100011`

---

### 4. B-type Instructions
**B-type (Branch-type)** instructions manage branching based on conditions.

#### Structure:
| Field Name | Size   | Description                     |
|------------|--------|---------------------------------|
| Opcode     | 7 bits | Specifies the instruction type  |
| rs1        | 5 bits | First source register           |
| rs2        | 5 bits | Second source register          |
| imm        | 12 bits| Immediate value for branching   |
| func3      | 3 bits | Defines the branch condition    |

#### Example: BNE r0, r1, 20
- **Operation**: Branches to the address `PC + 20` if `r0` is not equal to `r1`.
- **32-bit Instruction**: `0000000_00001_00000_001_10100_1100011`

---

### 5. U-type Instructions
**U-type (Upper Immediate)** instructions load immediate data into the destination register.

#### Structure:
| Field Name | Size   | Description                     |
|------------|--------|---------------------------------|
| Opcode     | 7 bits | Specifies the instruction type  |
| rd         | 5 bits | Destination register            |
| imm[31:12] | 20 bits| Upper immediate value           |

---

### 6. J-type Instructions
**J-type (Jump-type)** instructions enable jump operations, often used for implementing loops.

#### Structure:
| Field Name | Size   | Description                     |
|------------|--------|---------------------------------|
| Opcode     | 7 bits | Specifies the instruction type  |
| rd         | 5 bits | Destination register            |
| imm        | 20 bits| Immediate value for jump        |
